Comparison of Audio / Video Libraries
=====================================

Instead of using the built-in browser audio and video controls, you may decide that you want something custom and consistent over a range of browsers, perhaps with a fallback built in.

You could write a player yourself or use one of a number of JavaScript libraries, but which one to choose?

Your decision will rely on a number of a criteria that you consider important, these may range from licensing, pricing and support to visual aspects, accessibility, customization and media hosting. The aim of this article is to take a look at the various libraries out there and present the features of each one.
