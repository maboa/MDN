Comparison of Audio / Video Libraries
=====================================

Instead of using the built-in browser audio and video controls, you may decide that you want something custom and consistent over a range of browsers, perhaps with a fallback built in for browsers that don't support audio or video natively.

You could write a player yourself but dealing with the differences between browsers can be a pain. You could instead use one of a number of JavaScript libraries, but which one to choose?

Your decision will rely on a number of a criteria that you consider important, these may range from integration ease, licensing, pricing and support to visual aspects, accessibility, customization and media hosting. The aim of this article is to take a look at the various libraries out there and present the features of each one.

Not we have only included projects that appear to have been updated in the last 12 months - audio and video on the web is a fast moving area.

Licensing and Pricing
---------------------

Often one of the first considerations for many developers or designers are price and licensing so let's commence by looking at those two aspects.
